# HydroSense Lab, IIT Delhi

## The overarching goal of our research is to develop solutions that reduce the impact of natural disasters. We simulate and investigate the terrestrial hydrological cycle using physics-based and data-driven models. We also develop techniques and systems for monitoring and mitigating water-related natural hazards such as floods and droughts, with a special focus on the worst-affected regions of the world.
