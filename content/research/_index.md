# Research @HydroSense

The overarching goal of our research develops solutions for effective management of water resources and reducing the impact of natural hazards. Our research seeks to disentangle the complex relationships between geomorphology, climate, precipitation, and runoff generation using physics-based and data-driven models. Our interests include, but are not limited to:

	- Land surface/hydrologic modeling
	- Statistics and machine Learning, Data Assimilation
	- Hydrologic extremes, Flood and drought forecasting
	- Remote sensing applications in hydrology
	- Citizen Science


We have active and on-going collaborations with Scientists and Professors from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), University of Oklahoma/National Weather Center, UC Boulder, Indian Meteorological Department.
