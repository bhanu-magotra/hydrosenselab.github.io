# Research

The overarching goal of our research is to understand the water cycle and develop solutions that reduce the impact of natural disasters. Our research seeks to disentangle the complex relationships between geomorphology, climate, precipitation, and runoff generation using physics-based and data-driven models. Our interests include, but are not limited to:

	- Land surface/hydrologic modeling
	- Statistics and machine Learning
	- Data assimilation
	- Hydrologic extremes, Flood and drought forecasting
	- Radar and satellite precipitation
	- Remote sensing applications in hydrology
	- Crowdsourcing

We have active on-going collaborations with Scientists and Professors from:

	- NASA Goddard Space Flight Center 
	- National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
	- University of Oklahoma/National Weather Center
	- UC Boulder
	- Indian Meteorological Department
	- Department colleagues of IIT Delhi and other IITs
