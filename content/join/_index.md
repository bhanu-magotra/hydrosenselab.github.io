# Join our Lab!

The HydroSense lab was established in 2020 and we are in a phase of rapid growth. We recognize that diverse teams do better research. We constantly seek to develop a positive work environment of courtesy, engagement, and collaboration. If you would like to join us for pursuing PhD, you can Email the lead or talk to any of the PhD students to see if we are a good fit for you. We are always looking for motivated research scholars and interns.
