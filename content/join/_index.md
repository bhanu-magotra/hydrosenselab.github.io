# Join our Lab!                                                                                
We are constantly looking for enthusiastic researchers with a strong interest in physics-based and data-driven hydrological modeling, remote sensing applications, and scientific computing. In particular, if you would like to join us for pursuing your PhD, please contact Prof. Manabendra Saharia (msahsaria[a]iitd.ac.in). 

The HydroSense lab was established in 2020 and we are in a phase of rapid growth. We recognize that diverse teams do better research and we constantly strive to develop a positive work environment of professional courtesy, engagement, and collaboration. You are always welcome to talk to any of the PhD students to see if we are a good fit for you.
