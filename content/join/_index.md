The HydroSense lab was established in 2020 and we are in a phase of rapid growth. 

We are constantly on the lookout for enthusiastic researchers at all levels with a strong interest in physics-based and data-driven hydrological modeling, remote sensing applications, and scientific computing. In particular, if you would like to join us for pursuing your PhD, please contact Prof. Manabendra Saharia (msahsaria[a]iitd.ac.in) with your CV and interests.

We recognize that diverse teams are crucial for driving scientific excellence and innovation. We constantly strive to develop a positive and welcoming environment of professional courtesy, kindness, and collaboration. You are always welcome to talk to any of the PhD students to see if we are a good fit for you.
